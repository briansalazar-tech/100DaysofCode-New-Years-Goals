This project is part of the 100 Days of Code course by Angela Yu and the App Brewery.

For Day 89, the goal was to create a To-do list website. I had worked on this project at about the start of the new year so I decided to put my own spin on it and create a Flask application that tracks new years resolutions and goals.

I decided to create four seperate categories for goals: personal, professional, learning, and financial. Each one of those categories has its own table in a database and each category are dispalyed in their own individual list on the web page. The program was coded to be used by a single user with the ability to add, edit, delete and quickly complete goals that are added to the program.

Since the tables used to store data for each goal category are unique, there is a lot of repeat lines of code. For each functionality, it is multiplied by four since there are four categories. I would like to revisit this in the future and try to condence the program futher. Additional features that might be nice to add to this program would be to add error checking if a goal is a duplicate goal, as well as the capability to have multiple users.
